python fundamentals

## Project Description

To create program that will read a list of name from a text file (name.txt) and will
randomly pick a name from the list. great project for handing files and working with lists

project is from a daily email that i receive from Ardit Sulce who is a teacher on udemy and sends out
daily projects for beginners and or advance python users.


### How I am going about this project
Myself I have found writing down on scrape paper on the inputs of the user in and what the output
will be.


basically for this project we will just have a print statement of: 

Randomly selected name: 

in a name will just show up when the project is ran.

open the file with read() which was by the way it was just showing the first letter of 
the name. 

change it to readlines() and it showed the whole name.
